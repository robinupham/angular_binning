prior.ini
=========

CosmoSIS values file specifying wide priors on the seven cosmological parameters varied in this project. For use with a CosmoSIS pipeline such as [tomo_3x2_pipeline.ini](https://gaussian-cl-likelihood.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tomo_3x2_pipeline.html) in [gaussian-cl-likelihood](https://github.com/robinupham/gaussian_cl_likelihood).

Designed for use with the `list` sampler, whose input specifies the actual points in parameter space to explore. See the steps to reproduce Fig. 6 for an example.
